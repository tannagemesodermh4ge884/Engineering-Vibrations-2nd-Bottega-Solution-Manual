  * * Author: William J. Bottega
   
  * A thorough study of the oscillatory and transient motion of mechanical and structural systems, Engineering Vibrations, Second Edition presents vibrations from a unified point of view, and builds on the first edition with additional chapters and sections that contain more advanced, graduate-level topics. Using numerous examples and case studies to reinforce concepts, the author reviews basic principles, incorporates advanced abstract concepts from first principles, and weaves together physical interpretation and fundamental principles with applied problem solving. For each class of system, the text explores the fundamental dynamics and studies free and forced vibrations. This revised version combines the physical and mathematical facets of vibration, and emphasizes the connecting ideas, concepts, and techniques.
